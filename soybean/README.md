## Introduction
The average consumer may not realize that soy is found in almost everything they eat. It can be found on the coating of apples, in chocolate bars, and it comprises most of the vegetable oil we consume — some experts claim Americans consume almost 40 pounds of soybean oil each year.[^1] Despite its prominence in human food, the soybean is the most common item on the menu for farmed animals, who eat over 90 percent of what is grown today.[^2] In 2021, six percent of the earth’s surface was covered with soybeans.[^3]

Over the past three decades, soybean growers in parts of South America have developed a reputation as the villains behind the acceleration of Amazonian deforestation.[^4] However, the story is not so simple, as soy is a highly politicized crop, entrenched in questions of land ownership, supply chains, and value. It is also one of the world’s most genetically modified (GM) crops—in the United States alone, over 90 percent of soybeans are GM.[^5] While this has allowed soybeans to be grown in a variety of conditions while resisting weeds and pests, those same attributes make the plant dangerous to grow due to the toxicity of fertilizers and the ever-changing resistance of the plant to new chemicals.[^6]

## Humble Origins
Wild soybeans, *Glycine soja*, were originally found in a geographical range that “extends from Afghanistan in the west to Japan in the east, and from southern Siberia in the north to the subtropics of the Yangzi River valley.”[^7] *Glycine soja* is thought to have been “naturally distributed … as early as 9,000 years ago.”[^8] For its first couple thousand years of domestication, however, soy, like wheat at the time, was not considered a prized food for human consumption due to its difficulty to digest without being refined and cooked.[^9]

Soy’s reputation as a difficult-to-digest food began to change in the third century BCE, when a fermented soy product known as shi grew in popularity in China.[^10] Not long after, soy appears in the Fan Shengzhi shu, a Han dynasty agricultural text from the first century BCE.[^11] It provides detailed instructions on how to plant and cultivate soybeans (primarily, still, for animal feed) and even estimates what yields would be.[^12]

Soybeans have an innate ability to grow almost anywhere and survive almost anything; this resiliency has lead them to be referred to as “weedy.”[^13] In the beginning of the soybean story, people did not really choose the soybean—the soybean, an ideal crop with its ability to spread and resist adverse conditions, chose people.   As the authors of a recent publication noted, “Soybeans probably began their career in agriculture not as valued crops, but as weeds that could be eaten if necessary.”

## International Expansion
In the sixteenth century, soybeans were mentioned in herbalist Li Shizen’s medical manual *Bencao gangmu*, where he described how “virtually every part of the plant was used as medicine.”[^16]

{paragraph 6}

In 1765, Samuel Bowen, an Englishman who traveled to China with the British East India Company, brought soy seeds to the United States. He asked the surveyor general of Georgia to plant them for him, providing detailed notes about what soybeans could be used for including making soy sauce for export to England.[^17] Bowen also described how the Chinese produced vermicelli, a type of noodle, from soybeans. The surveyor general subsequently reported that the soybeans yielded three crops and might have yielded a fourth had there not been a frost.[^18] By the eighteenth century, demand for soybean was beginning to boom, and merchants were exporting soybeans from then-Manchuria, a fertile region of Northeast China, to other areas, including “Shanghai and Amoy, where the beans were processed into condiments or pressed for oil.”[^19] The European word for soy, “soya” comes from the Japanese word shoyu, or soy sauce; “the bean was named, in other words, for its processed product.”[^20] Centuries later, the soybean was taxonomized by Carl Linnaeus as glycine, meaning sweet, and max due to its large nitrogen-fixing nodules.[^21]

{paragraph 7}

In Germany in 1712, explorer Engelbert Kaempfer “published a 900-page description of Japan” in which he detailed the soy plant and the multiple products that could be made from it.[^22] It wasn’t until the late nineteenth century, however, that soy took off in Europe, At the Universal Exposition of 1873, a world’s fair held in Vienna, soybeans “grown in China, Japan, Mongolia, Transcaucasia and even Tunisia,” were displayed.[^23]

In Asia, Japan’s global influence was growing after its 1905 victory in the Russo-Japanese war—a war in which “soy was an incentive for conflict.”[^24] Japan's victory led to dramatic gains in the country’s mainland territorial control, and subsequently, an increase in soybean production: “between 1906 and 1921, soybean production grew from 600,000 to 4.5 million metric tons.”[^25] After the war, Poles brought back many different seeds, including soybean seeds. Many Poles subsequently began growing what they referred to as “Japanese beans,” in Poland.[^26]  Research on soybeans flourished in Poland after it gained independence from Russia; in 1930, Polish entomologist and crop scientist Czesław Marjan Bieżanko moved South America—living first in Argentina and later in a Polish settlement in Brazil—to teach Polish immigrants how to grow soybeans.[^27] In this roundabout way, soybean made landfall in Brazil.

In Europe, soybean research was booming. At the “Universal Exposition of 1873,” a world’s fair in Vienna, soybeans “grown in China, Japan, Mongolia, Transcaucasia and even Tunisia,” were displayed.24 Five years later, a German author published an entire book on soy and its potential uses. In Asia, Japan’s global influence was growing after its victory in the Russo-Japanese war – a war in which “soy was an incentive for conflict.”25 Japan's victory led to a dramatic increase in territorial control, and subsequently, an increase in soybean production: “between 1906 and 1921, soybean production grew from 600,000 to 4.5 million tons.”26 During this time, many Poles also began growing these “Japanese beans.” 27 Research on soybeans flourished in Poland, and in 1930, Polish intellectual Czesław Marjan Bieżanko moved to South America to inform Polish immigrants on how to grow soybeans.28 Thus, the soybean made landfall in Brazil.

##A Certain Crop During Uncertain Times

Immediately after WWI, farmers in industrial agricultural systems faced a soil crisis. To keep soldiers fed, many farmers in Germany and the U.S. turned to monocropping -- a farming technique which involves planting the same plant year after year -- which depleted the soil of nutrients. To solve their soil problems, farmers planted soybeans due to their ability to heal depleted soil through nitrogen fixation.29 Soy, the plant which was once looked down upon for its “weediness,” was being lauded for its potential to feed the nation and save the soil.
<param ve-iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/CAT87203600/page/n1/mode/2up">

The soybean also gained notoriety during the uncertainty of World War II. During the war, farmers and scientists began searching for different uses of the plant, and one innovator, Henry Ford, went so far as to create a car using soybeans.30 Soybeans were also prized due to their oiliness, which could be used for food, plastic, and maybe even fuel. During the beginning of WWII, the U.S. doubled its soybean production to meet wartime demands for “oil and soy by-products.”31 By the end of the war, soy was being used in “margarine, paint, mayonnaise, wallpaper, glue, and dynamite, to mention just a few.”32 WWII put the U.S. on the map as the world’s top soybean producer. That is until 2006 – when the top exporter could, for the first time, be found in the Southern hemisphere.

## The Creation of Ghost Acres

“Sojización” is a term used to describe the change in the landscape – primarily from rainforest to soybean fields – in the Amazon. 33 This era began in what is known as the “Second Great Acceleration,” a period when “the [center] of gravity of soy’s trade network shifted from the Global North to the Global South.”34 The Great Acceleration, which began around 1950, “emphasizes the shift of worldwide resource extraction, exchange, processing, usage and deposition on an unprecedented scale from the mid-twentieth century onwards”35 This extraction is a hallmark of sojización; in South America, almost all soy is exported to China or European countries. Thus, the natural resources of the region – like the rainforest – are being depleted for the consumption or use of people in countries abroad, creating an ecosystem known as “ghost acres.”36

The rising demand for soybeans is due to their use as a high-protein animal feed. In 1995, the Chinese government began prioritizing the cultivation of human-food crops such as rice and wheat due to population increases. China thus reduced the production of animal-feed crops like soy, and instead turned to countries like Brazil for import.37 In 2018, the annual flow of soybean from Brazil to China amounted to 27 million USD, and “the associated deforestation risk amounted to 61,500 ha, from which 34,600 ha resulted from the Brazilian-Chinese trade. Since forests serve as a sink of greenhouse gases, Brazilian deforestation caused 10.0 Mt emissions of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, of which the Chinese share was 5.6 Mt.”38 



The massive increase in scale of soybean production aligns with the introduction of genetically modified (GM) soybeans, such as Monsanto’s “Roundup Ready” soybeans, which were approved in Argentina and the United States in 1996 through the “principle of substantial equivalence,” which claims that “overall GM soybeans are similar to their non-GM equivalent, and thus represent no risk to the public health of the environment.”39 Since being released in Argentina in 1996, Roundup Ready soybeans have had “practically a 100 per cent adoption rate.”40 These genetically-modified organisms are resistant to glyphosate, an herbicide used to kill weeds, thus allowing growers to spray the herbicide, Roundup, without killing the plant. In 2012, 80 Olympic-size swimming pools – or 53 million gallons – “of glyphosate were sprayed across Argentina.”41

In 2003, local farmers in Argentina woke up to their food crops decimated. The culprit? The herbicide 2,4D, which was sprayed on now-glyphosate-resistant soybeans on large-scale farms the night before.42 The local farmers organized and hired an agrarian engineer to prove that their plants were killed by the herbicide. After analyzing the farmers’ physiological symptoms as well as the symptoms of the plants, the engineer recommended the local farmers destroy their crops due to their toxicity, rendering their harvests void.43 Throughout the next few months, farmers fought against the fumigation of soybean fields by using their bodies to block roads and using knives to slit airplane tires.44 Eventually, a judge ordered that large-scale growers stop fumigating soybean fields. But by then, it was too late; many local farmers had already left, terrified that their crops “could be destroyed by another agrochemical drift.”45 The aforementioned “principle of substantial equivalence,” was not as “equivalent” as it seemed; genetically modified soybeans require toxic herbicides, which kill non-genetically-modified crops, and over time, make humans sick too.46 The phrase ‘deforestation in the Amazon’ means so much more than just trees being cut down — in the case of soy, it signifies the erasure of lives and livelihoods.  

In April 2006, Greenpeace released a report stating that U.S. corporations “were responsible for 60 percent of the financing of Brazilian soybean agriculture.”47 The report also demonstrated where soy from the Amazon traveled; some soybeans ultimately ended up as animal feed for McDonalds chickens. McDonalds chicken nuggets were the product of chickens fed with soybeans grown on deforested Amazonian land.48 McDonalds responded to the report by pledging to “stop selling chicken fed on soybeans grown in newly deforested areas of the Amazon.”49 The pressure from the Greenpeace report resulted in a “soy moratorium” signed just two months after the report was released. The moratorium stipulated that trade associations could no longer buy soy from areas which were deforested from that point onward.50

While the moratorium seemed to work in theory – there was evidence that rates of deforestation for soybean production in the Amazon were slowing – in practice, instead of deforesting new rainforest, soybean growers were instead taking over cattle pastures. Thus, cattle farmers were pushed further out into the forest and soybeans were planted in their place. Cattle farmers, not soybean farmers, were then credited with deforestation.51 The soy moratorium applied to soy, not cattle, effectively creating a perfect loophole.52 While the soy moratorium may have put a stop to deforestation in favor of soy, it has not put a stop to deforestation. 

## The Fragility of the "Soyacene"

The soybean, from its resiliency to its versatility, chose humans. And today, humans are overwhelmingly choosing soybeans too. Soybeans are expected to have a record year in 2023 with an estimated 410.6 million metric tons which will be produced worldwide.53

The way that soybeans are currently being produced on a large-scale basis is unsustainable. Because soy is nitrogen-fixing, when soy is continuously planted after soy, it depletes the soil. In Argentina, for example, “36 per cent of Argentine territory – roughly 100 million hectares – has become eroded over the past 25 years.”54 And when it comes to Roundup and other genetically-engineered products? Those are short-lived; as soon as ten years after Roundup-ready soybeans were introduced to Argentina, glyphosate-resistant weeds began cropping up in Argentina too, causing growers to spray more toxic herbicides on their soy.55

When certain crops are grown in a monocrop fashion on a large scale, like soybeans, they lose nutritional value. This is due to the inverse yield nitrogen law, which states “that increased yields will be followed by a decrease in protein concentration.” 56 This creates a dangerous cycle where growers need to produce more crops to meet the same protein concentrations traders demand. 57  

Consumers who are often beneficiaries of ghost acres tend to take for granted the availability and cheapness of commodity crops like soybean. Even if consumers are not eating “direct” soy products like tofu or tempeh, they are likely consuming soy multiple times a day, whether by way of processed food or a coating on fruits and vegetables. The rising global demand for soy has only been met due to the destruction of other ecosystems. It is worth noting, as Maurício Torres and Sue Branford described, that “there is no such thing as empty land. Each tract of forest is used in some way, even if it isn’t inhabited.”58  

Although deforestation is happening at a slower rate in 2023 than it has in years prior in the Amazon, rates of destruction are rising in the cerrado, “an ecosystem that sits atop one of the world’s largest sweetwater aquifers.”59 And with global demand for soy only rising, will the soybean overtake that landscape too? According to the United Nations, the world produces enough food to feed everyone and have food leftover.60 And yet, we are clearing land to make room for a commodity crop which, at its core, feeds animals. The soybean has long been a source of prosperity for humans. Now, the replacement of ecosystems with soybeans is one large factor in the acceleration of anthropogenic climate change. Although humans are still choosing soybeans, a question naturally arises: should we?
